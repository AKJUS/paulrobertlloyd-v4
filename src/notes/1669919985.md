It’s been over six months since I discovered damp under my kitchen floor. Having taken up floorboards, traced the source of the leak, got the flooring repaired and then ordered replacement vinyl – with all the delays and disruption along the way – today I can finally look at a fully repaired floor. Honestly, this may be my highlight of 2022 (make of that what you will).
